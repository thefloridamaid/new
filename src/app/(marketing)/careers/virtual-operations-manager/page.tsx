              The Florida Maid Cleaning Service has been serving Florida since 2018. Rebranded and rebuilt from the ground up in 2025, we are now doubling in size month over month. We operate over 100 websites across Florida &mdash; from Miami to Jacksonville &mdash; driving organic growth across every market we touch &mdash; and the volume of business coming through our platform is accelerating fast.

              The owner, Jeff, brings 20+ years of experience in service-based businesses and marketing. He is caring, supportive, and genuinely invested in the people around him. He is also laser-focused, consistent, and operates with clear plans and expectations that must be met. He has an old-school customer service mentality combined with a modern marketing strategy that blends organic grassroots hustle with cutting-edge AI. When things go wrong he expects solutions &mdash; and he expects them to never happen again. When things run right, everyone wins.
