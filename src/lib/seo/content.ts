It\'s a complete reset for your home.' },
      { question: 'How much does a deep cleaning cost in Florida?', answer: 'Deep cleaning costs $49–$65/hr depending on who provides supplies. A typical condo deep clean runs $196–$260 (4–5 hours). A 2-bedroom is usually $260–$390 (4–6 hours). A 3-bedroom can be $325–$520 (5–8 hours). We charge by the hour so you only pay for the time your space actually needs.' },
      { question: 'How long does a deep cleaning take?', answer: 'Condo: 3–4 hours. 2-bedroom: 4–6 hours. 3-bedroom+: 5–8 hours. Duration depends on home condition, size, and any special requests. First-time deep cleans take longer than subsequent ones.' },
      { question: 'Should I get a deep clean before starting weekly service?', answer: 'Yes, absolutely. We always recommend a deep clean first. It establishes a clean baseline so your recurring weekly or bi-weekly cleanings are faster and more effective. After the deep clean, maintenance cleanings typically take just 2–3 hours.' },
      { question: 'Do I need to be home during the deep cleaning?', answer: 'No. Many clients leave a key, provide a garage code, or arrange access through their building management. You\'re welcome to be home or out — whatever is most comfortable for you.' },
      { question: 'Can I request specific areas to focus on?', answer: 'Absolutely. If your kitchen needs the most attention, or you want extra time in the bathrooms, just let us know. We customize every deep clean based on your priorities.' },
      { question: 'How often should I get a deep cleaning?', answer: 'If you have recurring weekly or bi-weekly service, you may never need another deep clean. Without recurring service, we recommend a deep clean every 3–6 months to prevent buildup. Seasonal deep cleans before and after hurricane season are especially popular with Florida homeowners.' },
      { question: 'Is deep cleaning worth it for a small condo?', answer: 'Yes. Condos have compact kitchens and bathrooms that accumulate grease, soap scum, and dust quickly — especially in Florida\'s humidity. A 3–4 hour deep clean completely resets the space. Most condo deep cleans cost $147–$260 — less than a dinner out.' },
      { question: 'What products do you use for deep cleaning?', answer: 'At $65/hr we bring professional-grade degreasers, bathroom cleaners, glass cleaner, microfiber systems, and a commercial vacuum. At $49/hr you provide your own products. We\'re happy to use eco-friendly or hypoallergenic products — just let us know.' },
      { question: 'Do you deep clean inside kitchen cabinets?', answer: 'Cabinet exteriors are included in every deep clean. Interior cabinet cleaning is available as an add-on — just mention it when booking and we\'ll allow extra time for it.' },

        'After a renovation, your home looks new — but it\'s far from clean. Construction dust is ultra-fine and coats everything: inside cabinets, on top of door frames, inside light fixtures, in vent returns, and on every horizontal surface. Standard cleaning doesn\'t cut it — this requires specialized tools and techniques.',
        'Post-construction cleanup typically happens in two phases. The first pass removes debris, bulk dust, and visible residue. The second pass is a detailed wipe-down of every surface, fixture, and opening. For major renovations, a third pass may be needed to catch the fine dust that resettles after the first two rounds.',
        'This is our most intensive service. A full home renovation cleanup can take 5–10 hours depending on the scope of work. Kitchen and bathroom renovations produce the most dust and debris due to tile cutting, grouting, and demolition.

      { question: 'Do you remove paint splatter from floors?', answer: 'Yes. We use professional-grade paint removers that are safe for tile, terrazzo, hardwood, and LVP flooring. For large areas of paint splatter, we\'ll address it as part of the floor cleaning phase. We cannot remove paint that has bonded into unsealed surfaces.' },
      { question: 'Can you clean while construction is still ongoing?', answer: 'We recommend waiting until all construction is complete. Cleaning during an active renovation means dust and debris will immediately re-accumulate. If you need an interim cleaning (for example, between phases), we can do that — but expect to book a final clean after all work ends.' },
      { question: 'Do you clean inside HVAC vents and ducts?', answer: 'We clean vent covers, registers, and the visible interior of duct openings. Full duct cleaning requires a specialized HVAC service. However, we strongly recommend changing your HVAC filter immediately after construction and again 30 days later — especially in Florida where the AC runs constantly.' },
      { question: 'Will one cleaning session be enough?', answer: 'For bathroom remodels and paint jobs, usually yes.

We follow enhanced sanitization protocols for medical and dental practices including EPA-registered disinfectants, proper waste handling, and attention to patient-facing areas. Let us know your specific requirements when booking.' },

      { question: 'Do you provide cleaning supplies for offices?', answer: 'At $65/hr we bring all cleaning products and equipment. At $49/hr you provide supplies. For office clients, we recommend keeping a supply closet with basic products, trash bags, and paper goods — we\'ll handle the rest.' },

  return [
    { question: 'Are your cleaners background-checked?', answer: 'Yes. Every cleaner on our team undergoes a comprehensive background check before their first assignment. We also carry general liability insurance and bonding for your protection. You can trust that the person entering your home has been fully vetted.' },
    { question: 'Do I need to be home during the cleaning?', answer: 'No. Many clients leave a key, provide a garage code, or arrange access through their building management. You\'re welcome to be home or away — whatever is most comfortable. We\'ll text you when we arrive and when we\'re done.' },
    { question: 'How do I book a cleaning?', answer: 'Text or call (954) 710-3636. Tell us your address, preferred date, and any special requests. We\'ll confirm your appointment and match you with a cleaner, usually within the hour. You can also book online at thefloridamaid.com/book/new.' },
    { question: 'What areas do you serve?', answer: 'We serve all of Florida\'s major metro areas — Miami, Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach, Tampa, Orlando, Jacksonville, Naples, and Sarasota, plus surrounding communities. Same rates everywhere — no travel surcharges regardless of location.' },
    { question: 'Do I pay before or after the cleaning?', answer: 'After. We never charge upfront or take deposits. You pay only after the cleaning is complete, before the cleaner leaves. We accept cash, Venmo, Zelle (hi@thefloridamaid.com), and credit card.' },
    { question: 'What if I\'m not satisfied with the cleaning?', answer: 'Let us know within 24 hours and we\'ll send a cleaner back to address any issues at no additional cost. We stand behind our work — your satisfaction is non-negotiable.' },
    { question: 'Do you bring your own cleaning supplies?', answer: 'At $65/hr, yes — we bring professional-grade products, microfiber systems, and a commercial vacuum. At $49/hr, you provide your own supplies. Either way, we\'re happy to use specific products you prefer (eco-friendly, hypoallergenic, etc.).' },
    { question: 'Can I request a specific cleaner?', answer: 'For recurring services, we automatically assign the same cleaner to your home every visit. For one-time bookings, we match you with the best available cleaner for your area and service type.' },
    { question: 'How far in advance do I need to book?', answer: 'We recommend booking 3–5 days ahead for the best availability. For same-day service, text us as early as possible — morning requests before 10am have the best chance of afternoon availability.' },
    { question: `Is ${service.name.toLowerCase()} available on weekends?`, answer: 'We offer service Monday through Friday 8am–6pm and Saturday 9am–4pm. Saturday slots fill up fast, so book early if you prefer weekend service. We do not offer Sunday service.' },
    { question: 'What payment methods do you accept?', answer: 'We accept cash, Venmo, Zelle (hi@thefloridamaid.com), and credit card (via Stripe). Payment is collected after the cleaning is complete, before the cleaner leaves. No deposits, no pre-authorization holds.' },

    { question: 'Do you offer eco-friendly or green cleaning?', answer: 'Yes. If you prefer eco-friendly, plant-based, or hypoallergenic products, just let us know when booking. At $65/hr we can bring green products; at $49/hr you provide your preferred products and we\'ll use them.' },
    { question: `Can I combine ${service.name.toLowerCase()} with other services?`, answer: `Absolutely. Many clients combine services — for example, a deep clean followed by weekly maintenance, or a move-out clean with post-construction cleanup. Let us know what you need and we'll create a custom plan.` },
    { question: 'What if I need to cancel or reschedule?', answer: 'For one-time services, we have a no-cancellation policy once confirmed. For recurring services, we require 7 days notice to cancel and 3 days notice to reschedule within the same week. This protects our cleaners\' schedules.' },
    { question: 'Do you clean condos, houses, or both?', answer: 'Both. We clean condos, townhouses, single-family homes, pool homes, waterfront properties, and estates. The hourly rate is the same regardless of home type.' },
    { question: 'How do you handle pets during cleaning?', answer: 'We\'re pet-friendly. If you have pets, let us know when booking so we can match you with a pet-comfortable cleaner. We ask that aggressive animals be secured in a separate room during the cleaning for everyone\'s safety.' },
    { question: 'Do you offer gift certificates?', answer: 'Yes — cleaning makes a great gift. Text us at (954) 710-3636 to purchase a gift certificate in any amount. We\'ll send a digital certificate that the recipient can redeem for any service.' },
    { question: 'What happens if something is damaged during cleaning?', answer: 'We carry general liability insurance specifically for this reason. If a cleaner accidentally damages something in your home, report it within 24 hours and we\'ll work with you to resolve it through our insurance coverage.' },
